# Gender-Pay-Calculator
This interactive was created for FundFire and is used solely for entertainment purposes.

This calculator uses base salary median pay gap data reported by asset management firms in the UK. “Other” is calculated from the average across asset management, which is 28.5%. To make this data more reflective of conditions in the U.S., an extra 1.3% is added to all firms’ reported median pay gap. This additional gap is based on the difference between the median U.S. and U.K. gender pay gap as measured by the OECD.
